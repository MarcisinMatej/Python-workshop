"""
In this excercise we compute adult BMI from this page: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html
You will have prepared command for reading input. 
Your task is to just implement the actual computation

Example: Weight = 68 kg, Height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
Calculation: 68 รท (1.65)^2 = 24.98

bmi = mass_kg / (heights_m /100)**2

# convert your weigth to stones:
