"""
In this excercise we will create very important tool for every hacker
and IT security person in the world. A script for finding prime numbers.
For this we will use so called sieve of Erasthotenes.

# Firstly create limit for our numbers
prime_limit = 0

# we will need two arrays
# list of prime candidates 
prime_candidates = []

# flags where we will remember if the number is prime

prime_flags = []

# now compute max divisor

max_divisor = 0

# iterate over all candidate divisor 

# iterate over all candidates and flag if the candidate is prime or not


# print only candidates which are prime
